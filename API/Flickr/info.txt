some problem with requests_with_caching.py code when it tries to use a prebuilt ""Permanent cache from flickr_cache.txt""

error is:-File "flickr_api.py", line 21, in get_flickr_data
    flickr_resp = requests_with_caching.get(baseurl, params = params_diction, permanent_cache_file="flickr_cache.txt")
  File "/home/ayush/Downloads/Python3/API/requests_with_caching.py", line 47, in get
    return requests.Response(temp_cache[cache_key], full_url)
TypeError: __init__() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given

We can hence opt not to use cache and directly use the requests.get()
but we dont have an api key id so it fails as the content is not fetched with error 
{'stat': 'fail', 'code': 100, 'message': 'Invalid API Key (Key has invalid format)'}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "flickr_api.py", line 30, in <module>
    photos = result_river_mts['photos']['photo']
KeyError: 'photos'

A new cache file is also generated as this_page_cache.txt so that the get requests can be stored here. But it also shows that the requests had failed without at API key and hence nothing is in the cache.


Permanent Cache=flickr_cache.txt
Temporary Caceh=this_page_cache.txt
